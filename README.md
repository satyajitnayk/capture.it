A cli network packet analyser written in GO.

# Project Idea: Network Packet Analyzer

# Description:
Develop a command-line network packet analyzer tool using Go. This utility will capture and analyze network packets, providing detailed information and insights about network traffic.

# Features:

1. Packet Capture: Utilize raw socket programming in Go to capture network packets in real-time.
2. Protocol Analysis: Implement parsers for various network protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) to extract relevant information from captured packets.
3. Packet Filtering: Provide options to filter packets based on criteria such as source/destination IP, port numbers, protocol type, or packet content.
4. Packet Inspection: Display detailed information about each captured packet, including source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocol details, packet size, and timestamps.
5. Traffic Statistics: Generate statistics and insights about network traffic, such as the number of packets per protocol, traffic volume, or top communication endpoints.
6. Connection Analysis: Identify and analyze network connections by tracking packets between source and destination IP addresses and ports.
7. Security Analysis: Implement basic security checks, such as identifying potential network attacks or suspicious patterns in the packet traffic.
8. Performance Analysis: Provide tools to analyze network performance metrics, such as packet loss, latency, or throughput.
9. Output Flexibility: Allow users to choose different output formats, such as plain text, JSON, or CSV, to facilitate further analysis or integration with other tools.
10. Configuration Options: Offer configuration options for fine-tuning the packet capture and analysis behavior, such as filtering rules, capture interfaces, or output settings.

# Notes:
1. By building a network packet analyzer CLI tool, you can leverage Go's low-level network programming capabilities to access and analyze network packets in a granular manner. This can provide insights into network traffic, security monitoring, or performance troubleshooting that may not be easily achievable through a GUI-based tool.

2. Remember to handle network packet capture and analysis with caution and respect privacy and security considerations. Ensure that users are aware of the legal and ethical implications of capturing network packets and advise them to use the tool responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
